Required dependencies:

`pygame`    : pip install pygame
`neat`      : pip install neat-python


`visualize.py` is completely optional. It requires some additional dependencies. Feel free to exclude that import. If you decide not to import that module, make sure to comment line numbers #342, #343, #344.
